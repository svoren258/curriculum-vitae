          I am working as a Web Developer specialized in frontend over 5 years, and I've been working on small to big-sized projects for
          multiple companies. I developed several PWAs, mobile apps, greenfield projects, libraries, plugins, and made bunch of performance
          improvements in already existing codebases with huge technical depths.
